#Much to our disappointment, we could not get BayesAss to work (for measuring migration)
#Discussion with colleagues suggested this program has lots of issues
#I ran the following code with adjusted paramaters for f, a and m as suggested in the documentation by Wilson and Rannala 2003, however, all runs resulted in files with just 0's
#After spending many hours battling BayesAss we decided that we would nto be able to include this analysis in our project
